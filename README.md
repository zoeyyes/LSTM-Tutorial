A basic plan

* Topic?  
  LSTM
* What theoretical concept(s) must be explained?  

* Backtracking: What simpler concepts can be used to explain it (them)? What will you assume your audience already knows?   

* Where could this fit in this course? Before what, after what?   

* What could serve as a hook to capture the reader's interest?  

* What skill(s) will you teach ("How to...")?  

* What might be the "wow" factor be in your project? (eg. a fun or surprising application, a cool plot, an R Shiny animation, a nice explanation of a theorem,...)
