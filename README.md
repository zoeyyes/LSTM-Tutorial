Week 7 (9 March)    
A basic plan

* Topic?  
  LSTM
* What theoretical concept(s) must be explained?  
definition of the activation function tanh  
long/short term memory  


* Backtracking: What simpler concepts can be used to explain it (them)? What will you assume your audience already knows?  
Basic ideas of naive RNN


* Where could this fit in this course? Before what, after what?   
after CNN & before SVM


* What could serve as a hook to capture the reader's interest?  
A metaphor that descibes the mechanism using how human brain works   



* What skill(s) will you teach ("How to...")?  


* What might be the "wow" factor be in your project? (eg. a fun or surprising application, a cool plot, an R Shiny animation, a nice explanation of a theorem,...)
