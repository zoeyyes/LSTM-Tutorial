Week 7 (9 March)    
A basic plan

* Topic?  
  LSTM  
  
* What theoretical concept(s) must be explained?  
1.why long/short term memory works  
2.how to apply long/short memory mechanism in neural netwok


* Backtracking: What simpler concepts can be used to explain it (them)? What will you assume your audience already knows?  
1.Basic ideas of naive RNN
2.Definition of the activation function tanh  

* Where could this fit in this course? Before what, after what?   
after CNN & before SVM

* What could serve as a hook to capture the reader's interest?  
1.a metaphor that descibes the mechanism using how human brain works   
2.comparision between RNN and LSTM
3.various applications of the powerful technique

* What skill(s) will you teach ("How to...")?  
1.how to 

* What might be the "wow" factor be in your project? (eg. a fun or surprising application, a cool plot, an R Shiny animation, a nice explanation of a theorem,...)  
1. an interesting dataset
2. the reason of choosing LSTM compared to other models
