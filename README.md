If you are interested in deep learning and natural language processing, then learning about Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is an absolute must. LSTMs are a powerful type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that are capable of learning and remembering long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation.

In this tutorial, you will learn the fundamentals of LSTMs and how they can be used to solve real-world problems in time series prediction. You can expect to have a glance on how to build an LSTM network from scratch using R and the popular deep learning library, Keras. 

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of LSTMs and their applications in processing sequential data. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced deep learning practitioner, this tutorial aims to provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to start building your own LSTM-based models and solving real-life problems. So, if you are ready to take your deep learning skills to the next level, then let's get started!
