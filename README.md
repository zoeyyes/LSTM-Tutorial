Week 7 (9 March)    
A basic plan

* Topic?  
  LSTM  
  
* What theoretical concept(s) must be explained?  
1.why long/short term memory works    
2.how to apply long/short memory mechanism in neural netwok  
3.loss function


* Backtracking: What simpler concepts can be used to explain it (them)? What will you assume your audience already knows?  
1.Basic ideas of naive RNN  
2.Activation function    

* Where could this fit in this course? Before what, after what?   
after CNN & before SVM  

* What could serve as a hook to capture the reader's interest?  
1.a metaphor that descibes the mechanism using the way human brain works     
2.comparision between RNN and LSTM  
3.various applications of the powerful technique  

* What skill(s) will you teach ("How to...")?  
1.how to apply LSTM in R  

* What might be the "wow" factor be in your project? (eg. a fun or surprising application, a cool plot, an R Shiny animation, a nice explanation of a theorem,...)  
1. an interesting dataset  
2. advantages of using LSTM, comparing to other models  

Timeline:  
week8  figure out the structure of the R script & find a suitable dataset & split work  
week9  working on the R script   
week10  working on the R script  
week11 make slides/scripts    
week12 presentation
